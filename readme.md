# Vite + Lingui.js POC

Showcase how to make lingui.js work with Vite.
For debugging purposes libs `@lingui/react` and `@lingui/macro` are brought over and macro is slightly modified as it could not run out of the box in Vite as it is published in version 3.7.1.

To run this on your machine, just install deps and run `npm run dev`.
